# Data Visualization with D3.js - Tree Map Visualizations

## Introduction

This project provides interactive tree map visualizations using D3.js for different datasets. The tree maps visually represent hierarchical data with rectangles, where the size of each rectangle corresponds to the data values. The project offers three distinct visualizations, each using data from different domains:

1. Tree Map of Movie Sales Data
2. Tree Map of Video Game Sales Data
3. Tree Map of Kickstarter Funding Data

Each tree map can be explored by hovering over the rectangles to view detailed information using tooltips.

## Technologies

The project is built using the following technologies:

- D3.js: A JavaScript library for creating data visualizations in the browser.
- HTML5: The structure of the web pages.
- CSS3: The styling of the web pages.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/felipegcruz/D3-Tree-Map.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-repo


3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the visualizations.

## Usage

The project provides three different tree map visualizations. Each visualization shows hierarchical data represented by colored rectangles. The color of each rectangle corresponds to its category. To explore the data:

1. Hover over the rectangles to see tooltips displaying the name, category, and value of the data.

2. The legend below each visualization shows the category colors and their corresponding names.
